--dev.reason.knowl
Developer
Reason explicitly
Annotate my program anywhere in the code with my current understanding of its
structure or execution
==categories
general location
==description
This general use case expresses the desire to place information about
a program's expected execution state in many different places throughout
the program - possibly including "upon function entry", "whenever this
line of code is executed", "at all times when a class of this type is not
actively executing a member function", or others.
--

--dev.reason.confidence
Developer
Reason explicitly
Express a spectrum of confidence in my annotations, from “unsure” and asking
for validation, to “sure” and asking for some effect to be applied (eg.
“maybe”, “definitely”, “assume” 'something')
==categories
general metadata
==description
This high level use case expresses the need to attach information to contract
conditions that is beyond the statement of the condition itself, and instead
has user-provided metadata about both the confidence in the condition and the
desired behavior of the program in relation to that condition.
--

--dev.reason.importance
Developer
Reason explicitly
Express a spectrum of importance of my annotations, from "critical" (eg. bring
the system down) to "minor" (eg. lead to a slower fallback)
==categories
general metadata
==description
This high level use case expresses the desire to have metadatda on contract
conditions associated with what downsides violations might have, perhaps
indicating that while a certain condition is expected to be met, the library
does guarantee that the downsides will not be catastrophic.
--

--dev.reason.cost
Developer
Reason explicitly
Express a spectrum of expected cost at compile or runtime of my annotations,
from "unrunnable" to "expensive" to "cheap"
==categories
general metadata
==description
This use case expresses the desire to have metadata about contract conditions
that capture at least 3 (if not more) granularities of "cost" to be used as
input in some way to other decisions about what the contracts might do or how
they might be interpreted.
--

--dev.reason.behavior
Developer
Reason about executions
Have annotations affect the execution of my program in accordance with my
expectations
==categories
general behavior
==description
The desire to have the expected behavior explicitly defined by the standard
in order to help users reason about what a program will do/has done when a
contract is violated.  Note that having this in the standard allows for
leveraging expectations of behavior across all compliant platforms.
--

--dev.reason.sideeffects
Developer
Reason about executions
Ensure annotations do not substantially change the meaning of my program when
enabled
==categories
general behavior
==description
There is a tension between allowing side effects in contract conditions and
disallowing them completely.  In general, writing code with absolutely no side
effects is very hard, and there are pitfalls if the language is actively
hostile to accidental side effects.  On the other hand, conditions with side
effects are also not elidable by the compiler, since the act of checking them
is observable.

* N4810 contracts made any side effect undefined behavior.
* P1670 suggested allowing side effects but also, when contracts are runtime
checked, allowing elision of the predicate (along with its side effect) if the
predicate result can be determined.
--

--dev.reason.behaviorcontrol
Developer
Reason about executions
Have the effect of annotations on executions be user controllable (ie. decide
whether “cheap” checks or “critical” terminates)

when building code, what behavior (if any) is associated with a contract
condition.

Have annotations affect executions depending on my existing build modes (eg.
Debug or Release modes in VS)
==categories
control
==description
Note that "debug" and "release" are not standardized things, but nothing
specified in the standard should preclude those from having some impact on
what behaviors contracts take on in those two modes.
--

--cdev.contracts
C Developer
Write contracts on my functions
Specify contracts in a way standardizable as part of the C language
==categories
syntax
==description
Important considerations for C are related to any contracts that can go on a
normal C function.  C does have attributes, but it also explicitly calls out
that a conforming implementation can ignore all attributes, as opposed to C++
which has made that a commonly held assumption but has not actually put wording
in the standard to that effect.
--

--cdev.identifiers
C Developer
Write contracts on my functions
Use contracts with macro-safe keywords that are reserved C names (i.e., _Pre,
_Post, _Assert, etc.)
==categories
syntax
==description
Adding new identifiers with meaing in C is generally not acceptable for
standardization, so compatible contracts would either need to use no contracts
or support alternate reserved words for use with contracts.
--

--cdev.violationhandler
C Developer
Write contracts on my functions
Have a common violation handler for both violated C and C++ contracts
==categories
violations
==description
Importantly, satisfying this requirement would mean making the the argument
to a violation handler meaningful in both C and C++, or requiring platform
vendors to shim between the two (in the case of a C violation handler receiving
a violation from C++ code).
--

--cdev.ignorable
C Developer
Write contracts on my functions
Make all contract semantics optional (so as not to change WG14-N2385 6.7.11 p2)
==categories
behavior
==description
Assuming contracts continue to be rendered as attributes, C standardization
would require they be semantically optional.

Note that, just as with C++, the ':' in the preivous contract syntax does not
match the grammar for attributes in either language, so by a strict reading of
the standards there is no obligation to be ignorable.  ('[[a:b]]' is not a
valid attribute and shoudl be diagnosed as invalid on any current C or C++
compiler).   Many have expressed the view that this opinion is pedantic and
that the spirit of the law is that anything between [[]]s should be ignorable.

--api.establish.validate_invariants
API Developer
Establish a contract
Have validation inform me which class invariants are violated
==categories
general location
==description
Class invariants have historically been considered of general use, but the
performance impact of checking them can be surprisingly huge.  Previously
these have bene left out of proposals for C++ to be added in at a later
date.
--

--api.establish.values
API Developer
Establish a contract
Have validation inform user which input values are unexpected or invalid
==categories
general behavior
==description
The more detail available to users about how a contract condition has been
violated the more useful they become.  This means each specific condition
is benefitted by being separate (eg. 'x != 0' and 'y != 0' as distinct
conditions instead of requiring that users use 'x != 0 && y != 0').

In addition to that, anything that might be able to capture those values
and expose them to violation handlers for logging would again help benefit
problem diagnosis.

--api.express.values
API Developer
Express predicates
Make reference to either the values of my inputs, or other in-scope identifiers
==categories
contents
==description
Predicates could be limitted to being "completely pure" and referencing no
global state, but in general reference to both inputs and other identifiers
beyond the scope of a single function call become needed to fully specify
contracts.
--

--api.establish.changedvalues
API Developer
Establish a contract
Make reference to the before and after values of in-out variables (ie. passed
by pointer or reference) in post-conditions
==categories
contents
==description
Postconditions often need to state things about how values of output parameters
have changed, or how the values of other global state might have changed
as a result of a function call.  The ability to store copies of state from
before the function call and reference that in a postcondition predicate will
enable a wieder variety of conditions to be formulatable.

Ada has this funcitonality builtin by providing ways to reference expicitly
the original value of a function parameter. C++ makes this more complicated
with the need to consider the handling of move-only or generally non-copyable
types.  More importantly, such copying should absolutely not happen if a
contract is not being evaluated at runtime.
--

--api.establish.changedmembers
API Developer
Establish a contract
Make reference to the before and after values of mutable class members (eg.
<i>new_size = old_size+1</i> after push_back) in post-conditions
==categories
contents
==description
Capturing the pre-function state of member variables might also be needed
to state the contracts on many member functions.
--

--api.establish.changedstate
API Developer
Establish a contract
Make reference to the before and after values of global state (eg.,
<i>global &gt;= old(global) + 1</i>) in post-conditions
==categories
contents
==description
Capturing arbitrary global state for use in a postcondition might prove useful.

This extends to the state of arbitrary other expressions and how that might change
due to the invocatino of a function.  Consider this example of what might
be a postcondition of a typical `sleep` function:

```
old(now()) <= now() + sleep_time
```
--

--api.extend.exceptionsafety

Exception safety guarantees are often part of the english language contract of

--api.extend.threadsafety

--api.express.runnability
API Developer
Express unrunnable contracts
Be able to use a predicate that is not evaluated at runtime, because it might
be unsafe to run or have stateful side effects
==categories
contents metadata
==description
Numerous predicates that might be useful to state also might change the
state of a program in a pardoxical way if checked.  The common example
(originally put forward in P0380) is validating available items on an input
iterator.  Other important examples include checks that might require accessing
special hardware, or doing extensive computations that would invalidate the
results just by taking the time to do them.

These predicates are still useful for those reading the code, still might
benefit from being validated against postconditions of other functions, and
might provide some identifiable code improvements when analyzed by hte compiler
without actually executing them at runtime.
--

--api.express.undefined
API Developer
Express unrunnable contracts
Be able to use a predicate that doesn’t have a definition, because it hasn’t
been written yet, or is infeasible to run
==categories
contents metadata
==description
Often during developement it helps to write contracts first, and that might
even predate having enough of an implementation to fully define the conditions.
Having them in code ensures that the placeholder api to check them is
maintained.  Some functions may never be implementable due to time constraints,
while others will eventually be filled in as time allows.
--

--api.express.uncheckable
API Developer
Express uncheckable contracts
Be able to use a predicate that is not evaluated, because it is simply a
semantic placeholder for a tool
==categories
contents metadata
==description
Some predicates might even have no meaning within the language itself, but
benefite other tools by being placed into the same contract framework as other
predicates, with meaning to those external tools.
--

--api.express.unimplementable
API Developer
Express uncheckable contracts
Be able to use a predicate that cannot have a complete definition, because it
is inexpressible in the language
==categories
contents metadata
==description
Many external static analysis tools, and even compilers, can check that
some state is being handled properly which cannot be properly validated within
the language itself.  Consider functions such as "is_deletable" or
"is_reachable".
--

--api.establish.responsibility
API Developer
Establish responsibility boundaries
Inform users which errors are the responsibility of the caller, and which are
the callee
==categories
violations
==description
One common realization with having checked contracts in the language is that 
they will then identify bugs that exist in programs.  Identifying the source
of those bugs swiftly is important, and for any contract that is dependant on
a function being called properly that responsibility does not usually lie with
the line of code where the contract is written, but with the place where
the function has been called.
--

--api.resp.preassert
API Developer
Establish responsibility boundaries
Annotate assertions inside function bodies that indirectly test preconditions
(such as malformed data discovered while performing the algorithm) should be
reported to the caller as precondition failures
==description
Some function preconditions can be expressed as c++ expressions, but are
runtime-expensive.  However, if expressed inside function body as assertions
after some function logic has already been executed,  the check whether the
function has everything that is required is cheap. If I use an assertion like
this,  I want to annotate this assertion as being "precondition-like". The
semantics would be that if it fails,  it is reported as "caller's bug" rather
than callee's bug, and if the build is configured  to runtime-check only
preconditions, such assertion should also be runitme-checked.

As an example, consider a binary search that wishes to check that the input
list is sorted.  There is an expensive check (O(n)) that can be done to verify
that the whole list is sorted on each call, but this would negate the
performance benefits of doing a binary search to begin with.  Another option
is to check just that the elements adjacent to those that are visitted are in
properly sorted order.  This will provide some chance of identify unsorted
inputs without making performance unusable, but is also most cleanly done
during the execution of the search algorithm.  Unlike a normal in-body
assertion, a violation identified by this kind of check should be reported to
the caller, as it is a failure on the callinig code's part to provide a
properly sorted input list.

--api.contract.interface
API Developer
Have contract as part of my interface
Declare contract when I declare the function
==categories
general location
==description
Putting contracts on the first function declaration makes them easily visible
to anyone looking at a header file for understanding an API.
--

--api.contract.private
API Developer
Keep my user interfaces clean and narrow
Be able to access private implementation details of the class so I don’t have
to widen public interface to declare predicates
==categories
contents
==description
Often, an interface might be very narrow - consider the interface on an
iterator, which generally just has a few operators and no other functions -
yet there  might be ways to check parts of a narrow contract that depend on
internal state.  Exposing this state so that it can be checked publicly would
require wideninig the API interface, which is counter to the desire to keep
the use of a type as simple as possible.

On a similar note, sometimes the internal state only approximates the actual
contract, and while better than no checking there is a desire to not expose
that data publicly so that there is no assumption that the data represents
the complete set of requirements on calling code.
--

--api.contract.redeclaration
API Developer
Keep my public interfaces clean and concise
Place function contract conditions on any declaration (e.g., on redeclarations
at the bottom of the header, or on the definition in an implementation file,
where they are less distracting).
==categories
location
==description
Many development methodologies revolve around making readable, well-documented
header files to provide a way to understand API usage. Some contracts might
be simple and readable, but others might involve complex conditions that
distract from readability, and match very simple to read and understand prose
contracts in the documentation.

The benefits (checkability, analysis, etc.) of having the encoded contracts
should not come at the cost of making the primary visible public interface
(the header file) more unreadable.
--

--api.contract.errorhandling
API Developer
Move contract violation out of error handling
Replace uses of error handling to express contract violation (eg.
<i>operator[](size_t n) noexcept [[pre: n &lt; size()]]</i> instead of
throwing)
==categories

==description
Historically, rather than providing functions with narrow contracts, software
might have been written to report misuse through exceptions.  Contracts should
provide a better alternative than giving all functions a fully wide contract.

==description
P4810 did not allow any varaition in contract conditions through overrids of
a virtual function, though this could be roughly accomplished with assertions
in function bodies instead.

In general, the pre and postconditions of the interface you call through should
be checked to be sure you're meeting the requirements you want to meet.
Similalrly, the concrete type's conditions should be checked to be sure it is
behaving properly.  Doing both checks if they are different might be an
acceptable solution to allow flexibility without any increase in risk, at the
possible cost of some perormance in checked builds.

Requirements on an interface to a function should be imposible when entering

==description
General class invariants should be checked for vaidity before and after any
call to a public member function of a class.  Calls to friend functions need
to be considered as well, as they might benefit from invalidating/validating

In general, any callback based solution exposes functions that will be called

--cpplib.insulation
C++ Library Developer
Control the tradeoff between need for client recompilation and contract condition visibility
Insulate contract conditions with the function definition, or insulate only the
definition while putting contract conditions on a redeclaration - visible to
static analysis tools in all TUs.
==categories
location
==description
Contract conditions on only the first declaration (as proposed by P4810) mean
that the condition clutters the readable interface and changes in a contract
condition force client recompilation.  Contract conditions not in the header
file are not going to be visible to tools that are attempting to limit what
they consume to a single translation unit.  Combined, these result in a desire
to sometimes put the contracts with the implementating definition (in a .cpp
file) and sometimes put them in a redeclaration in a header file (where one
might also put inilne function definitions).

For free functions this would just require relaxing the requirements on where
contracts are.  For member functions, allowing member function redeclaration
would be needed to put the contracts in a less obtrusive place that is still
visible outside of the defining TU.  See P1320 for more discussion of this.
